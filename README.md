I came across a compelling dataset courtesy of Maven Analytics while in search of a project, focusing on stolen vehicle data from the New Zealand Police Department's vehicle of interest database spanning six months. Each entry in the dataset encapsulates details of a singular stolen vehicle, encompassing information such as vehicle type, make, year, color, date of theft, and the region of theft.

Per the dataset, a staggering 4527 vehicles have been reported stolen, with the majority of theft incidents occurring on Mondays, totaling 760 occurrences, while Saturdays saw the fewest thefts, standing at 576 instances.

Notably, station wagons take the lead among stolen vehicle types, with 954 reported cases, followed closely by saloons at 851. Conversely, special purpose vehicles, articulated trucks, trail bikes, and mobile machines registered minimal theft occurrences, each with only one reported case. This trend is consistent across various regions in New Zealand, indicating a uniformity in the types of vehicles predominantly targeted by thieves.

Examining the model years of stolen vehicles reveals that 2005 models were the most targeted, with 346 thefts, closely followed by 2006 models at 333. In contrast, vehicles from 1980 and earlier were the least targeted, with only 65 thefts reported. However, this pattern varies depending on the vehicle type. For instance, in the case of 2005 models, theft occurrences for saloons, hatchbacks, and station wagons were 84, 83, and 75, respectively, while sports cars, light vans, and heavy vans from the same year totaled just 5 thefts combined.

Among the reporting regions, Auckland recorded the highest number of stolen vehicles, with 1626 cases, trailed by Canterbury with 660. Conversely, Nelson and Southland reported the fewest thefts, with 92 and 26 incidents, respectively. A closer analysis of regional population demographics reveals a correlation between population size and theft rates: Auckland and Canterbury, boasting the highest populations, reported the most thefts, while Nelson and Southland, with lower population figures, reported fewer theft incidents.

The slicer buttons located at the top of the dashboard offer an additional avenue for delving deeper into the dataset. #dataanalytics #dataanalysis #datavisualization
